# Script to calculate r_c, from Shizuka & Farine
#
# This is an example script for calculating community assortativity (r_c) from empirical data. 
# We use the tit dataset available through the asnipe package. **Note that the figure in the 
# publication excludes a single isolate node for clarity. 
# We assume that the data is in a "group-by-individual" format, where groups appear in rows,
# individuals appear in columns, and cell value is 1 if the individual is seen in the group 
# and 0 otherwise. A 'group' here is defined as a set of individuals observed in close proximity
# during a given observation data point.
